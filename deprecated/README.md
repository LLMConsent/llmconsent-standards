# Deprecated LLMConsent Standards

This directory contains standards that have been deprecated and superseded by newer versions.

## Deprecation Policy

Standards are moved here when:
- Superseded by a newer standard
- Found to have critical flaws that cannot be fixed
- No longer relevant to the ecosystem
- Community consensus to deprecate

## Deprecated Standards

*No standards have been deprecated yet.*

## Format

When standards are deprecated, they will be stored here with:

```
deprecated/
├── LCS-XXX-deprecated-YYYY-MM-DD.md
├── migration-guides/
│   └── migrate-from-LCS-XXX.md
└── archives/
    └── implementations/
```

## Migration Guides

Each deprecated standard will include:
1. **Deprecation notice** - Why it was deprecated
2. **Migration guide** - How to move to the new standard
3. **Timeline** - When support ends
4. **Tools** - Automated migration tools if available

## Historical Record

Deprecated standards remain available for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding protocol evolution

## Warning

**⚠️ DEPRECATED STANDARDS SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS**

These standards are preserved for historical purposes only. Always use the current standards from the [core](../core) directory.
