# LLMConsent Extension Standards

Extension standards build upon the core LLMConsent protocol to add specialized functionality.

## Current Extensions

*No extension standards have been accepted yet. Be the first to propose one!*

## Proposing an Extension

Extension standards extend the core protocol without modifying it. Good candidates for extensions include:

- Industry-specific consent requirements
- Additional privacy mechanisms
- New consent token formats
- Specialized agent capabilities
- Enhanced attribution methods
- Alternative economic models

### Requirements for Extensions

1. **Must not break core standards** - Extensions add functionality without breaking existing implementations
2. **Clear use case** - Solve a real problem not addressed by core standards
3. **Implementation feasible** - Can be implemented without excessive complexity
4. **Community interest** - Has support from potential users

### How to Propose

1. **Discuss First**: Start a discussion in the community forums
2. **Draft Proposal**: Create an LCP-E (Extension) proposal
3. **Reference Implementation**: Build a proof of concept
4. **Submit PR**: Follow the process in [PROCESS.md](../PROCESS.md)

### Extension Categories

#### Privacy Extensions
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Homomorphic encryption
- Secure multi-party computation
- Enhanced anonymization

#### Economic Extensions
- Alternative compensation models
- Staking mechanisms
- Reputation systems
- Market mechanisms

#### Interoperability Extensions
- Cross-chain bridges
- Legacy system adapters
- Industry standards mapping
- Protocol translations

#### Governance Extensions
- DAO integration
- Voting mechanisms
- Dispute resolution
- Compliance frameworks

## Extension Naming

Extensions follow the naming pattern: `LES-XXX` (LLMConsent Extension Standard)

- LES-001 to LES-099: Privacy extensions
- LES-100 to LES-199: Economic extensions
- LES-200 to LES-299: Interoperability extensions
- LES-300 to LES-399: Governance extensions
- LES-400+: General extensions

## Compatibility

Extensions must:
- Work with core standards v1.0.0+
- Not require changes to core standards
- Be optional (core functions work without them)
- Document their dependencies clearly

## Template

Use this template for extension proposals:
