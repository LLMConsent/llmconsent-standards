# LLMConsent Governance Charter

## Mission

The LLMConsent Standards Working Group develops and maintains open standards for AI consent management, ensuring no single entity controls how AI systems interact with human data.

## Principles

### 1. Open Governance
- **No Single Owner**: The protocol is community-owned
- **Transparent Process**: All decisions made in public
- **Open Participation**: Anyone can contribute
- **Rough Consensus**: Decisions by community agreement, not voting

### 2. Technical Excellence
- **Interoperability**: Standards work across platforms
- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, elegant solutions
- **Security First**: Cryptographic verification built-in
- **User Sovereignty**: Users control their data

### 3. Decentralization
- **No Admin Keys**: No ability to freeze or seize
- **Multiple Implementations**: Encourage diversity
- **Protocol, Not Platform**: Define standards, not systems
- **Permissionless Innovation**: Anyone can build

## Organizational Structure

### Standards Working Group

The Working Group consists of:

- **Contributors**: Anyone submitting proposals or feedback
- **Maintainers**: Review proposals and manage process
- **Implementers**: Build reference implementations
- **Community**: Users and stakeholders

### Roles

#### Contributors
- Submit LCP (LLMConsent Proposals)
- Provide feedback on proposals
- Report issues and bugs
- Participate in discussions

#### Maintainers
- Review proposals for completeness
- Facilitate community discussion
- Merge accepted standards
- Maintain repository

Current Maintainers:
- Subhadip Mitra (Founding Maintainer)
- [Open positions - apply via proposal]

#### Implementers
- Build reference implementations
- Test standards compliance
- Report implementation feedback
- Maintain SDKs

### Decision Making

1. **Proposal Submission**: Via LCP process
2. **Community Review**: Minimum 30 days
3. **Rough Consensus**: General agreement reached
4. **Implementation**: Reference implementation required
5. **Acceptance**: Standard marked as Final

### Conflict Resolution

When consensus cannot be reached:

1. **Extended Discussion**: Additional 30 days
2. **Alternative Proposals**: Submit competing LCPs
3. **Implementation Testing**: Build prototypes
4. **Last Resort**: Founding maintainer decision (sunset after 2 years)

## Standards Process

### Stages

1. **Draft**: Initial proposal
2. **Review**: Community feedback period
3. **Last Call**: Final comments (14 days)
4. **Final**: Accepted standard
5. **Deprecated**: Superseded standards

### Requirements

#### For Draft → Review
- Complete specification
- Clear motivation
- Security considerations
- At least one supporter

#### For Review → Last Call
- Community rough consensus
- No unresolved objections
- Implementation plan
- Test cases defined

#### For Last Call → Final
- Reference implementation
- No critical issues
- 14-day final comment period
- Maintainer approval

## Versioning Policy

### Semantic Versioning

- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes
- **Minor (0.X.0)**: New features, backwards compatible
- **Patch (0.0.X)**: Clarifications, typos

### Compatibility Requirements

- **Backwards Compatible**: Minor versions must not break v1.0
- **Migration Path**: Major versions include migration guide
- **Deprecation Period**: 6 months minimum notice
- **Parallel Support**: Multiple major versions can coexist

## Amendment Process

### Amending Standards

Accepted standards are immutable. Changes require:

1. **New LCP**: Propose amendment
2. **Reference Original**: Link to standard being amended
3. **Justification**: Clear reasoning for change
4. **Impact Analysis**: What breaks, what's affected

### Amending Charter

This charter can be amended via:

1. **Proposal**: LCP-CHARTER-[number]
2. **Extended Review**: 60 days minimum
