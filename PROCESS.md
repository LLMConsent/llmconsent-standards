# LLMConsent Standards Process

This document describes how to propose, review, and approve LLMConsent standards.

## Overview

The LLMConsent Standards Process (LSP) is designed to be:
- **Open**: Anyone can propose standards
- **Transparent**: All discussions are public
- **Rigorous**: Standards must be implementable
- **Collaborative**: Community-driven development

## LCP: LLMConsent Proposals

All standards begin as LLMConsent Proposals (LCPs).

### LCP Format

```markdown
# LCP-[NUMBER]: [TITLE]

**Author(s)**: [Names]
**Status**: Draft
**Type**: Core | Extension | Informational
**Created**: [Date]
**Requires**: [LCP dependencies]

## Abstract

## Motivation
[Why is this needed?]

## Specification
[Complete technical details]

## Rationale
[Design decisions and alternatives]

## Backwards Compatibility
[Impact on existing standards]

## Test Cases
[Required for Final status]

## Implementation
[Reference implementation or plan]

## Security Considerations
[Security implications]

### LCP Types

- **Core**: Changes to core protocol (LCS-001 to LCS-004)
- **Extension**: New functionality building on core
- **Informational**: Best practices, guidelines

### LCP Numbering

- Core: LCP-C-[number] (e.g., LCP-C-001)
- Extension: LCP-E-[number] (e.g., LCP-E-001)
- Informational: LCP-I-[number] (e.g., LCP-I-001)

## Submission Process

### 1. Pre-Proposal Discussion

Before formal submission:

1. **Check Existing Work**: Review current standards and proposals
2. **Community Discussion**: Post idea in discussions
3. **Gather Feedback**: Refine based on input
4. **Find Champion**: Get maintainer support

### 2. Formal Submission

Submit via GitHub:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create `proposals/LCP-[TYPE]-[NUMBER].md`
3. Complete all required sections
4. Submit pull request
5. Post to mailing list

### 3. Initial Review

Maintainers check for:
- Completeness
- Proper formatting
- No obvious issues
- Unique contribution

**Timeline**: 7 days

## Review Process

### Stage 1: Draft

**Duration**: Variable (author-controlled)

Requirements:
- Complete specification
- Posted as pull request
- Author championing

Activities:
- Community feedback
- Iteration on design
- Building consensus

### Stage 2: Review

**Duration**: Minimum 30 days

Requirements:
- Maintainer sponsor
- No major open issues
- Implementation planned

Activities:
- Formal review period
- Structured feedback
- Resolution of concerns

### Stage 3: Last Call

**Duration**: 14 days

Requirements:
- Rough consensus achieved
- Implementation started
- Test cases defined

Activities:
- Final opportunity for objections
- Minor clarifications only
- Prepare for acceptance

### Stage 4: Final

Requirements:
- Reference implementation
- Test suite passing
- No unresolved objections
- Maintainer approval

Result:
- Assigned LCS number
- Moved to `/core` or `/extensions`
- Marked as accepted standard

## Review Criteria

### Technical Merit

- **Completeness**: Fully specified
- **Clarity**: Unambiguous language
- **Implementability**: Can be built
- **Interoperability**: Works with existing standards

### Process Requirements

- **Consensus**: Community agreement
- **Implementation**: Working code
- **Testing**: Comprehensive tests
- **Documentation**: Clear and complete

### Security Review

All proposals must address:
- Threat model
- Attack vectors
- Mitigation strategies
- Privacy implications

## Fast Track Process

For urgent security fixes:

1. **Security Disclosure**: Private disclosure to maintainers
2. **Rapid Review**: 72-hour review period
3. **Emergency Acceptance**: Single maintainer approval
4. **Post-Hoc Ratification**: Community review after fix

## Amendment Process

### Minor Amendments

For typos, clarifications:

1. Submit pull request
2. Maintainer review
3. Direct merge if non-breaking

### Major Amendments

For substantive changes:

1. New LCP required
2. Reference original standard
3. Full review process
4. Deprecation of original

## Deprecation Process

### Deprecation Criteria

Standards may be deprecated if:
- Superseded by new standard
- Security vulnerability discovered
- No longer relevant
- Community consensus

### Deprecation Steps

1. **Proposal**: LCP proposing deprecation
2. **Notice Period**: 6 months minimum
3. **Migration Guide**: Required documentation
4. **Archive**: Move to `/deprecated`

## Appeals Process

If proposal rejected:

1. **Clarification**: Request detailed feedback
2. **Revision**: Address concerns and resubmit
3. **Alternative**: Submit competing proposal
4. **Escalation**: Appeal to full maintainer group

## Tools and Automation

### Validation Tools

- `validate-lcp.py`: Check proposal format
- `test-implementation.sh`: Verify reference implementation
- `check-compatibility.py`: Backwards compatibility testing

### CI/CD Pipeline

All proposals automatically:
- Format validated
- Links checked
- Tests run
- Security scanned

## Best Practices

### For Authors

1. **Start Small**: Focus on one problem
2. **Show Examples**: Include code samples
3. **Consider Users**: Think about adoption
4. **Be Patient**: Consensus takes time

### For Reviewers

1. **Be Constructive**: Suggest improvements
2. **Focus on Technical**: Avoid personal opinions
3. **Test Claims**: Verify with code
4. **Respect Time**: Review promptly

### For Implementers

1. **Follow Spec**: Implement exactly as written
2. **Report Issues**: Feedback improves standards
3. **Share Code**: Help others implement
4. **Document Experience**: Write guides

## FAQ

### How long does the process take?

Typically 2-6 months from proposal to acceptance, depending on complexity and consensus building.

### Can I withdraw my proposal?

Yes, authors can withdraw at any time before Final status.

### What if my proposal is rejected?

You can revise and resubmit, or work with the community to address concerns.

### Who decides on proposals?

The community through rough consensus, with maintainers facilitating the process.

### Can standards be changed after acceptance?

No, accepted standards are immutable. Changes require new proposals that supersede old ones.
